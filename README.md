Terminal version of Minesweeper.

Dig a square by selecting a row,column. Every time you dig, numbers will appear.
The numbers indicate how many mines neighbours that particular square. 
Use this information to deduct where all the mines are.
If you dig all the board except where the mines are, you win. 
If you dig where there is a mine, you blow up into pieces and die miserably.

Good gaming!
